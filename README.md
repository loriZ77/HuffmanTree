# HuffmanTree -- Codes
<br>

> The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a program that can encode and decode data using prefix encodings.

Requirement:

read messages from either the keyboard or a file

write messages to the screen or to a file

write a binary encoding to a file using either binary or hexadecimal. For example, the binary encoding:

1100000101101101101011010110110101101011011111101011
could be written in hexadecimal as:

C16DAD6D6B7EB
read and write an prefix encoding to a human-readable text file.




## Implements

* Code is an interface that declares methods of construction of Huffman encoding.

* HuffmanCode is the class that defines method implementations declared by interface. 
Given a source message, use Huffman Algorithm construct prefix encoding.
Encode and decode messages by symbol->code dictionary containing a prefix code.

* Driver class can read and return strings in a selected file.
